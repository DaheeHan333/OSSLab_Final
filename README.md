made by Dahee Han 21700765.

## Welcome to Final Project For OSS Lab!
This project is for final project for OSS-Lab session at Handong Global University.

Please feel free to look to the source codes if you need it.

I used the template on w3shcools.com.


## What does this project do?

"Visuallization of sorting algorithms" is a web site where you can see animted process of six types of sorting algorithms with pseudocode. 
This web site made of HTML, Java Script language.

This project offers :
1. a visuallization of sorting process : bubble-sort, selection-sort, insertion-sort, merge-sort, quick-sort, heap-sort
2. pseuocode of each algorithms
3. some quiz about six algorithms

In this project, raspberrypi will be used, so you can simply access the web site through web browser.

## Why is this project useful?

I found a very useful web-site that shows the process of B+trees while I was studying Database course.
I could see the whole process by inserting and deleting node that I want to on this web-site. It was very helpful for me.
Therefore, I wanted to develop something about sorting alorithms since sometimes they confused me. 
That was the reason why I chose this topic and developed this web site.
You can see an normal process of each of them at once.


## How do I get started?


It is very simple.
1. Get into the same local internet connection with this raspberrypi server.
2. Start a web browser.
3. Type "raspberrypi.local" on the web browser.
4. You would see main page.
5. You can move by scrolling down or choosing menu bar on the left side. 
6. It will offer an animated GIF file and pseudocode.
7. Also, you can take a pop quiz and then check the answer.



## Where can I get more help, if I need it?
