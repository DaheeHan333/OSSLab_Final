This project is for final project for OSS-Lab session at Handong Global University.

Please feel free to look to the source codes if you need it.

I used the template on w3shcools.com.


## What does this project do?

"Visualization of sorting algorithms" is a web site where you can see animted process of six types of sorting algorithms with pseudocode. 


I developted the server with ngix
This web site made of HTML, CSS, Java Script language.

This project offers :
1. a visualization of sorting process : bubble-sort, selection-sort, insertion-sort, merge-sort, quick-sort, heap-sort
3. pseuocode of each algorithms
4. some quiz about six algorithms


## Why is this project useful?

I found a very useful web-site that shows the process of B+trees while I was studying Database course.

I could see the whole process by inserting and deleting node that I want to on this web-site. It was very helpful for me.

Therefore, I wanted to develop something about sorting alorithms since sometimes they confused me. 

That was the reason why I chose this topic and developed this web site.

You can see an normal process of each of them at once.
